Each idea fits these criteria:</p><ul><li>Could be implemented in 200 hours (13 weekends).</li><li>Fits the Decent architecture – local LLM, no service calls, running in a web browser.</li><li>Fair chance of being useful or entertaining to somebody.</li><li>Fits the guidelines for including an app on the Decent Apps portal.</li></ul><p>You might look at an idea and think, “that idea isn't new at all. I've seen it in Product X”.</p><p>Of course, it’s very hard to do a brand new thing. Ideas build off previous ideas, and maybe your iteration of an existing idea brings new value. Or you end up making a privacy-respecting, free, open-source version of what already exists, and that is enough to earn you some user attention. And not everything needs to be unique to be valuable – there’s the value of showcasing your talent in a public space as well.</p><p>We encourage you to tweak these ideas how you like or even just use them as inspiration for new ideas of your own. There is no ownership of ideas here. Use as much or as little from them as you like.</p><div class="post__toc"><h3>Table of Contents</h3><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236h">Introduction</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236i">Format of the Ideas</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236j">Category - Education</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236k">Name: Learn a Document</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236l">Name: Language Roleplay</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj9a3as37h">Name: Language Simplifier</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236m">Category - Work/Productivity</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236n">Name: Anonymizer</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236o">Name: Source Code Evolver</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236p">Name: Customer Feedback Classifier</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236q">Name: Knowledge Card Expert</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236r">Name: Link Manager</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236s">Category - Personal Tools</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236t">Name: Family Tree Modeler</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236u">Name: Bibliography Generator</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh236v">Name: EULA Checker</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh2370">Name: Places I’ve Been</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh2371">Name: Opinion Explorer</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imj78uh2372">Name: Private Idea Evaluator</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imjc2rr43pa">Category - Fun and Games</a><ul><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imjc2rr43pb">Name: Imposter</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imjc2rr43pc">Name: I'm Thinking Of A...</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imjc2rr43pd">Name: Guess Who I Am</a></li><li><a href="#mcetoc_1imjc2rr43pe">Name: Stump Speech</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236i" class="western">Format of the Ideas</h2><p>Here are the common elements that appear with each idea.</p><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td width="19%"><p>Element</p></td><td width="81%"><p>Explanation</p></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td width="19%"><p>Name</p></td><td width="81%"><p>Tends to describe what the app does rather than be a good name.

Paste or upload some text into the app. Then the app generates questions about the doc and asks the user for answers. Each time the user provides an answer, they receive immediate feedback on the correctness of their answer.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>A mastery score that increases as the user demonstrates more knowledge. The user aims to reach a certain mastery.</li><li>Coloring or marking the source document to show which areas the user understands well.</li><li>App notices weak areas and asks more questions around them.</li><li>Multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank questions that make it easier for the user to progress.</li><li>Load content from a web page URL. (Requires some intelligent scraping to get the intended context)</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236l" class="western">Name: Language Roleplay</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app assists language learning for intermediate learners by having chats in the target language around role-played situations. For example, the user interviews for a job as a cook at a restaurant, and must answer some interview questions from the LLM who is roleplaying a hiring manager at the restaurant. Each situation has a desired outcome, e.g. “get hired as a cook”, and the LLM will have some criteria like “user must say the names of three kinds of foods” or “user must say which days of the week they are able to work”. The LLM will gently prod the user to meet these success criteria.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Some artwork showing the situation would be nice. E.g., show an illustration of a restaurant kitchen and the hiring manager along with the chat window.</li><li>Multiple lessons/situations organized by difficulty. User’s progress is tracked.</li><li>User can look up words they don’t know.</li><li>A way to get advice on improving the user’s responses, maybe after the user has completed the situation.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj9a3as37h">Name: Language Simplifier</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app creates simplified versions of text that are more likely to include vocabulary and grammar familiar to a language learner. The user pastes/imports some text into the app and then requests simplification. The LLM generates a simplified version of the text in the target language for the learner.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>User can specify a target level such as CEFR (A1/A2/B1/B2).</li><li>The app tracks or imports known versus unknown vocabulary and can make replacements based on it</li><li>Grammar-level simplifications can be made, e.g. "use only present tense" verbs</li><li>User can get definitions for words they don't know</li></ul><h1 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236m" class="western">Category - Work/Productivity</h1><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236n" class="western">Name: Anonymizer</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app takes freeform text provided by a user and rewrites it to remove any information or style that might identify the author of text. Useful for cleaning up anonymous survey responses.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Batch mode – import an XLS/CSV and anonymize each row</li><li>Parameters – UI shows what things user would like to anonymize (names of people, dates, etc.) and lets user tweak them.</li><li>Consequence analysis – some messages might have more consequences if the anonymity were lost for the author. For example, an angry rant about coworkers. These could be flagged for manual review.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236o" class="western">Name: Source Code Evolver</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app begins with a some small amount of code, maybe a few hundred lines, that is pasted/imported by the user. The user specifies some transformation to be made on the code, for example “add comments explaining what each function does” or “remove any functions that aren’t called by main()”.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Versioning – ability to revert back to any previous version and see differences between versions.</li><li>Unit tests – ability to check that the code hasn’t broken as various changes are made by running unit tests. (This is tricky to do safely, and needs some thought. LLM-generated code passed to `eval()` is not safe on its own.)</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236p" class="western">Name: Customer Feedback Classifier</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app takes customer feedback for a product or service and classifies it as belonging to specific product features. So for example, if some customer feedback text is “The paper keeps jamming whenever I try to print.” the feedback could be classified as “paper feed tray” which is a category that can be applied to multiple items for organization, analytics, and routing. The user of the app can set up their category definitions and specify guidance for classifying, e.g. “problems with paper jamming are classified as ‘paper feed tray’ unless the customer mentions using glossy finish paper.”</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Batch mode - import an XLS/CSV and run classification on each row.</li><li>Auto-categorize – generate a set of categories automatically by analyzing a collection of customer feedback for common themes across many feedbacks.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236q" class="western">Name: Knowledge Card Expert</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Advanced</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app takes a question from a user and finds a knowledge card that correlates well to the question. A chat-based interface blends LLM-generated responses with knowledge cards that show pieces of factually verified information.</p><p>In this way, the user is protected somewhat from LLM hallucinations that might otherwise cause the user to be given incorrect advice. So for example, a user might ask “How much does the professional tier subscription cost?” and the LLM could display a card inside of the chat window with official pricing information, and maybe output some text after it like “I found this pricing information for the professional tier.”</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Import knowledge cards from an XLS/CSV.</li><li>Scores relevance of multiple knowledge cards and presents multiple cards to user.</li><li>Gives answers that synthesize what was found on knowledge cards and presents its reasoning in the the chat session.</li><li>Can generate new knowledge card drafts that are unverified. A human must review these before they become verified.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236r" class="western">Name: Link Manager</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Advanced</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app catalogs links to all the web pages you provide it and provides a better way of finding them again than the “Bookmarks Bar”. This is especially good for keeping track of work-related information. The user pastes a new link into the app. An LLM then works in the background to describe and index the page and its contents. Later, the user may find the link again with keyword searches that match the index.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>There are many refinements that can be made to indexing and querying. For example, some keywords like “the”, “and”, “we”, etc. are common and should influence returned results less or not at all compared to more unique words.</li><li>Support for contiguous word (keyphrase) searches like “best practices” rather than finding documents that have “best” and “practices” in them.</li></ul><p><strong>Hints:</strong></p><p>There are easy and hard ways to make the basic functionality work. Just to show how it can be done, let’s describe one of the easier approaches (still pretty advanced for a quick project):</p><ol><li>User pastes a URL.</li><li>App fetches the content at the URL and parses it with a third-party library like Cheerio or JSDom into plaintext.</li><li>Prompt the LLM to identify the areas of plaintext that look informational instead of UI and chrome (e.g. button text, navbar, footer links).</li><li>Prompt the LLM to create a paragraph-long summary of the informational content and a title for the page. Store this metadata along with the URL as a link entry.</li><li>Parse the doc for all unique words found and store them in a lookup index, where each keyword maps to one or more link entries.</li></ol><h1 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236s" class="western">Category - Personal Tools</h1><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236t" class="western">Name: Family Tree Modeler</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app receives information from a user in chat like “I have three brothers, Mike, Tom, and Larry.” and immediately updates a family tree graph to show each new piece of information.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Export graphs to an image format, e.g. SVG, PNG.</li><li>The app notices logical problems and mistakes and asks questions to clear them up, e.g. “Your brother Mike is also your father?”</li><li>App asks the user questions to fill out the tree, like “Do Shane and Emma have any kids?”</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236u" class="western">Name: Bibliography Generator</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app generates bibliographies with citations with all correct formatting. The user only needs to paste freeform content about the publication. Useful for students or writers.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>User provides URLs to Amazon web pages or other web pages that have info about the publication. (requires intelligent scraping)</li><li>Put rich-text formatted bibliography in clipboard so it can be pasted into a text editor like Word, Google Docs, etc.</li><li>Parameters for specifying a style (Chicago, APA, MLA, Harvard, AMA, etc.)</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh236v" class="western">Name: EULA Checker</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app reviews end user license agreements and calls out terms that seem non-standard or particularly important to the user. It can be used to check for potential privacy violations (selling data to third parties), IP ownership of data/ideas contributed by user, or other things. Some care would need to be taken not to give legal advice to the user, but rather present summaries with linkage to the original text.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>User can specify what kinds of things are important to them with a simplified UI (e.g. checkbox for “privacy concerns”).</li><li>User can specify additional things to check for (e.g., “Anything that requires me to use mediation” or “Any penalties where I might owe them money for something”).</li><li>Ability to track previous versions of EULAs and show what has changed in updates.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh2370" class="western">Name: Places I’ve Been</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Advanced</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app tracks all the cities in the World a user has visited and can answer chat prompts about them. User clicks a “Where Am I Now?” button that uses the Geolocation API of the browser to perform a nearest-city lookup and then that city is added to their history. The user can later ask questions like “What cities have I been to in Germany?” and receive LLM-generated answers based on their travel history.</p><p>The nearest-city lookup can be done without service calls—just divide all the city data up into static-content chunks that cover geography and use HTTP GET fetches to retrieve a dataset of cities close to lat/long provided by Geolocation.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Display locations on a map. (Some work to figure out how to do this without sharing personal data, but it seems possible.)</li><li>Generate reports that show all the countries and cities a user has been to. Make them easily sharable on social networks for users to brag.</li><li>Track multiple visits to the same place over time.</li><li>User can add their own comments about each place. Or maybe retain a chat history that is specific to each city, so that past conversations with LLM about a city are retained.</li><li>LLM can generate flavor information about a city automatically. E.g., for Chicago the LLM might generate “Birthplace of the skyscraper and deep dish pizza.<strong>”</strong></li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh2371" class="western"><strong>Name: </strong><strong>Opinion Explorer</strong></h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Advanced</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app generates visual graphs that classify different opinions people can take on a given topic and why they might have them. The app becomes a quick way to see the wide range of possible opinions on a topic instead of just being exposed to a small number of views.<br><br>Imagine a question with some controversy to it like “Should we use more nuclear power for our energy needs?” The LLM generates a graph of potential answers. It might first be broken down into high-level “Yes”, “No”, and “Maybe” categories. And each category can break down with refinement into more nuanced positions, like under “No”, we might have “We may create a dangerous anomaly not currently understood by scientists”, “We don’t have a sustainable way to store nuclear waste”, or “The sites make attractive targets for military and terrorist attacks”.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Chat-based conversations between user and LLM that reference the generated opinions as context.</li><li>User can directly edit the graph and add their own nodes to it.</li><li>User can designate some opinions as carrying more weight to them and dismiss others. So it becomes a tool for organizing one’s thoughts and sometimes arriving at a decision on a question.</li><li>Export as a visual graph that can easily be shared on social media and other places.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imj78uh2372" class="western">Name: Private Idea Evaluator</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>This app helps a user evaluate their idea with no fear of it being shared elsewhere, e.g., included in training data. The local LLM architecture can assure that all conversation about the idea stays on the user’s device. The user explains their idea, potentially in a structured way to hit certain key questions (e.g., “who would benefit from your idea?”). The LLM can provide feedback on the idea and describe similar efforts/ideas that already exist.</p><p>Example: User describes their idea as “It’s a restaurant where you can just try any breakfast cereal you want. We have all the cereals you could find commonly in a grocery store, and more esoteric cereals as well.” The LLM responds back with existing attempts at this idea like the Cereal Killer Café in London, and offers some ideas for differentiation.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Encrypt-at-rest storage of idea conversations for the paranoid</li><li>Chat sessions oriented more around brainstorming</li><li>Tracking variations of the idea in a graph-like structure along with pros and cons of each. E.g. “cereal buffet – all cereal is free, but you pay for milk”, “mix and match, create your own cereal”.</li></ul><h1 id="mcetoc_1imjc2rr43pa">Category - Fun and Games</h1><h2 id="mcetoc_1imjc2rr43pb">Name: Imposter</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>In this game, you are a spy that must blend in under an assumed identity. You talk with other people who are roleplayed by the LLM. If you are sufficiently convincing, you win the game. But if you don't sound like the person you aim to portray, an LLM-controlled character will accuse you of being an imposter, and you will lose.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Once you have the basic gameplay working, it's easy to add more characters and scenarios.</li><li>Artwork with character's faces and the room is nice.</li></ul><p><strong>Hints:</strong></p><ul><li>You can get the LLM to speak in the voice of a character with some prompt grounding.</li><li>In the same grounding, explain the conditions in which the character would accuse the player of being an imposter and instruct the LLM to use the keyword "imposter" in an accusation.</li><li>Your chat processing code can look for the keyword "imposter" in completion output and use it to signal the "lose" condition for the game.</li><li>If the player successfully says X (maybe 10?) things to the LLM without triggering the "lose" condition, then that signals the "win" condition for the game.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imjc2rr43pc">Name: I'm Thinking Of A...</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>In a chat session, the LLM announces "I'm thinking of a well-known fictitious character. Ask me questions and guess who it is." The user asks questions that narrow possibilities and eventually guesses.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Different kinds of objects (e.g., famous person, city, animal, movie) can be picked by the user to start off the game, giving it more variety.</li><li>Set a limit on the number of guesses the user can make or incentives to make less guesses, e.g. three stars if you can guess in less than five.</li><li>Let the player ask for hints if they get stumped.</li></ul><p><strong>Hints:</strong></p><ul><li>This can all be accomplished with grounding that tells the LLM the basic rules of the game. In the grounding, instruct the LLM to output "victory" or some keyphrase when the user has guessed the correct answer.</li><li>Your chat processing code can look for the victory keyword and use it to signal the "win" condition for the game.</li><li>The initial object that is picked could come from a pre-generated list or you could use LLM prompting to generate the object.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imjc2rr43pd">Name: Guess Who I Am</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Easy</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>In a chat session, the LLM announces "I am a famous person. I can't tell you my name.  Ask me questions and guess." The user asks questions that narrow possibilities and eventually guesses.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>Have the LLM mimic the famous person by talking like them and using phrases that they would.</li><li>Set a limit on the number of guesses the user can make or incentives to make less guesses, e.g. three stars if you can guess in less than five.</li><li>Let the player ask for hints if they get stumped.</li></ul><p><strong>Hints:</strong></p><ul><li>This can all be accomplished with grounding that tells the LLM the basic rules of the game. In the grounding, instruct the LLM to output "victory" or some keyphrase when the user has guessed the correct answer.</li><li>Your chat processing code can look for the victory keyword and use it to signal the "win" condition for the game.</li><li>The initial person that is picked could come from a pre-generated list or you could use LLM prompting to generate it.</li></ul><h2 id="mcetoc_1imjc2rr43pe">Name: Stump Speech</h2><p><strong>Difficulty:</strong> Medium</p><p><strong>Basic Functionality:</strong></p><p>The user is a corrupt politician that will pander and lie to gain popularity. They are on a campaign tour of different towns, each with its own set of people that want different things. At each stop on the tour, the user will be given a randomly generated set of issues and talking points. These will be things like "40% of population favor tax cuts" or "10% believe the resevoir's drinking water is intentionally poisoned". The user gives a short speech that panders to the audience. Their popularity increases or decreases based on how successfully they've pandered.</p><p><strong>Extra Feature Ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>This would work well with speech recognition to let the user speak aloud like a politician. Consider using a local speech recognition capability such as Whisper or Vosk-Browser.</li><li>If you don't like the politics angle, the game could be rethemed in different ways. Imagine a conference room where you pitch a business idea, and people in attendance can be convinced with pandering, e.g. "Barney always likes ideas about efficiency and cost-cutting and Lanelle hates it when people use sports and team metaphors".</li></ul><p><strong>Hints:</strong></p><ul><li>The LLM can receive a series of prompts like "Evaluate {speech} for how it achieves {condition} and output a number between 0 (does not achieve condition at all) and 100 (fully achieves condition)". After you have a score for each condition, it's just a little more math to calculate an overall success score for the speech.</li><li>Avoid using the LLM for parts that don't need it so that the game runs quicker.</li></ul><p> </p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="./privacy-policy.html" class="al" target="_self">privacy policy</a></li><li><a href="./contact-us.html" class="al" target="_self">contact us</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright ©2023-2025 by the respective authors.
