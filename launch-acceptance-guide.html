You won't be evaluated in a competitive way. If you can complete these steps without any blocking problems, we will be very happy to work with you.</p><p>These steps are a bit of a skill check to make sure you can handle the basics. But we <em>always</em> respect your time and appreciate the chance to collaborate. The steps are just doing work towards developing your app.</p><h1>Step 1 - Choose an App Idea</h1><p>Here is an example app idea from <a href="./ideas-for-decent-apps.html">Ideas for Decent Apps:</a></p><blockquote><p>Idea: This app quizzes the user on the contents of a document to help the user learn. Paste or upload some text into the app. Then the app generates questions about the doc and asks the user for answers. Each time the user provides an answer, they receive immediate feedback on the correctness of their answer.</p></blockquote><p>Notice the following:</p><ul><li>The idea is short. You don't need to say a lot!</li><li>The proposed features only cover basic functionality of the app. (The "Minimum Viable Product" section below explains the benefit of keeping your launch featureset small.)</li><li>The idea describes the experience from the <em>user's</em> point of view, rather than as a set of technical capabilities. By expressing the idea this way, it's easy for us to understand what you're trying to accomplish without getting into implementation details. And it puts some focus on the app being valuable to a user.</li></ul><p>The sections below give more advice on picking a good app idea. If it begins to feel overwhelming, consider that we're probably going to accept any idea you have for the program as long as it fits <a href="./decent-portal-app-requirements.html">Decent Portal App Requirements</a>. And you do have the option of choosing any idea from <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/page/null">Ideas for Decent Apps</a> - all of the ideas listed there will fit the requirements.</p><h2>Why a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is Good</h2><p>This program is designed to launch your app in 90 days. To be successful in that short of a time, the functionality of your app idea should be for a <em>minimum</em> viable product.</p><p>A good question would be: <em>why not 180 days or a year? Shouldn't we just launch the software when it's ready?</em></p><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/13/90daysMvp.jpg" alt="" width="1814" height="424" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="./media/posts/13/responsive/90daysMvp-xs.jpg 640w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/90daysMvp-sm.jpg 768w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/90daysMvp-md.jpg 1024w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/90daysMvp-lg.jpg 1366w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/90daysMvp-xl.jpg 1600w, ./media/posts/13/responsive/90daysMvp-2xl.jpg 1920w"></figure><p>We don't actually insist that you launch your app in 90 days, but that is the goal. 90 days is a typical amount of time needed to make a small web app. You will be working with a group of other app developers in the program aligned on that same timeframe. This can generate good energy. It's like we're all wanting to reach the top of a mountain together!</p><p>You can always add features to your app after it's released. And when you have users trying your app out, filing bugs and feature requests, that's when it gets exciting. Rather than you guessing in isolation about what will make your app valuable, your users will just tell you.</p><p>To launch fast, pick the <em>minimum</em> set of features that would make a useful app. And then you can iterate with feedback from users after launching</p><blockquote><p>"Real artists ship." -Steve Jobs</p></blockquote><h2>Decent Architecture Compatibility</h2><p>You might have a full-stack background and be used to writing services for front ends. But we are doing something different here - <em>there won't be any service calls</em> in your decent app. In fact, our Decent Portal hosting will have CSP directives to block all but a handful of white-listed domains (e.g., Hugging Face for model downloads).</p><p>We want to expand the Decent Portal capabilities in the future to allow for cross-device synchronization and collaboration between users. But it will take some time to develop these capabilities following <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local-first principles</a> that match the Safe+Easy+Playful vision of the Decent Portal.</p><p>What does this mean for choosing an app idea? If your idea depends on a service, it's not going to fit the Decent architecture. The ideas below are examples of concepts that probably require a call to a service, and therefore wouldn't be Decent-compatible.</p><ul><li>An app calls a search engine API to find information on a topic.</li><li>An app stores user data in an AWS S3 bucket.</li><li>Multiple users simultaneously edit a document together. (Requires some service for messaging or synchronization.)</li></ul><p>This local-first stuff is tricky if you're not used to it. But it unlocks beautiful things. If the approach still seems confusing, for now, just stay away from app ideas that need services, and your idea should work for the Decent Portal.</p><h2>Another Possibility - Tech Demos</h2><p>Suppose you are more motivated to explore a technical capability rather than build an app for users. That still works for our program! A tech demo can be a smart approach when you're trying to show what is possible or develop a more fundamental capability usable for other features. Here is an example tech demo idea:</p><blockquote><p><em>Idea: This app demonstrates how a prompt injection attack is performed, and shows a collection of techniques for preventing prompt injection attacks. The app UI displays an example prompt injection with fields for the original prompt, the injected payload, and maybe other parameters such as what model to use. User can execute the prompt and see results. It is meant to be educational to software developers and security researchers and improve the overall awareness and security around LLMs.</em></p></blockquote><p>Some other ideas for tech demos:</p><ul><li>Named Entity Filtering demo to remove hallucinations based on Michael Wood's ideas. (<a href="https://medium.com/cub3d/eliminating-hallucinations-lesson-1-named-entity-filtering-nef-5f5956d748e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some amazing claims</a> made by Michael Wood--it would be wonderful to reproduce his results.)</li><li>Tool calling demo that shows how well an agent can pick the right tools to call for different problems.</li><li>Building knowledge graphs from user-supplied information.</li><li>Reducing chat completion time by compressing prompts before they are sent. </li></ul><p>A tech demo is a great complement to published research or articles, e.g. "Why Prompt Injection Matters and What You Can Do About It". And with the Decent Portal you can host a tech demo that everyone immediately can try without worrying about token costs.</p><p>So if you're struggling to find an app idea that is centered around a user experience, consider making your app a tech demo.</p><h1>Step 2 - Create a Repository</h1><p>After you've picked an idea, it's time to create your repository.</p><p>Create a new public repository on Github under your Github account. This repo will contain the source code and other files needed to build your app.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">The new repo must be <em>public</em>, not private.</p><h2>Does It Have to Be on Github?</h2><p>We don't insist that you use Github. If you want to use something else, it might be more work for you, but it should be okay. Here's the criteria that matter to us:</p><ul><li>It's a git repository.</li><li>It's public. (All the source that builds your app is in the repo, accessible to the general public - not just us.)</li><li>The solution has a CI environment like Github Actions that will deploy directly to our portal. You might have to adapt our deployment scripts to do this.</li></ul><p>This openness is part of keeping apps on the Decent Portal safe and trusted for users.</p><h1>Step 3 - Check In Initial Project Files</h1><p>After creating your repo, you'll next populate it with some starting project code that's pretty close to a "Hello, World" app.</p><ol><li>Use the <a href="./create-decent-app-quick-start.html">`create-decent-app` tool</a> to generate a starting project within your working directory.</li><li>Edit the "README.md" file to match your app idea from step 1. Your idea description can be inserted into the beginning of the README.</li><li>Make sure you can build the app and run it in a dev server.</li></ol><h2>If You Have Trouble</h2><p>We have sympathy for anyone who has trouble with these steps - we all start somewhere, right?</p><p>We will help with any problems related to `create-decent-app` itself. (This software is pretty new, and maybe we've got some bugs to fix in it.) But the basic steps of setting up, building, and running a new Node project use skills we're expecting you to already have or pick up quickly based on your preexisting experience writing software.</p><h1>Step 4 - Send Us a Link to Your Repo</h1><p>Finally, just e-mail us a link to your newly-populated repo, and we'll check it out. This is not a competitive evaluation. As long as we don't hit blocking problems that we can't get past easily, you'll be accepted.</p><p>You can email us with questions about the steps along the way.</p><p>We're hoping you'll have these steps completed before the program start date (shown below). It creates good group energy for everyone in the program to start at the same time.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">The next Decent Launch Program starts on April 14th.</p><p>We appreciate very much your willingness to work with us. Let's build some apps!</p><p> </p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="./privacy-policy.html" class="al" target="_self">privacy policy</a></li><li><a href="./contact-us.html" class="al" target="_self">contact us</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Copyright ©2023-2025 by the respective authors.
